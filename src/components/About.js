      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate data scientist and software engineer with a diverse
        background in data analysis, machine learning, and system engineering.
        My journey began with a focus on data visualization, research, and
        machine learning model development, which allowed me to expand my
        expertise in database management and automation. I work with tools like
        Oracle, Snowflake, Python, and Excel to enhance data cleaning and
        streamline processes. One of my most recent achievements involved
        leading the development of a Proof of Concept (POC) that modernized
        mainframe data extraction tasks. Using React for the frontend and Python
        for the backend, I successfully presented this POC to clients, securing
        approval for full-scale development. My hands-on experience in
        automation includes implementing RPA tools to optimize mainframe
        processes and building data flow pipelines on Google Cloud Platform
        (GCP). I also have a solid track record in research and development for
        machine learning, including projects in deep learning and AI for
        industries like healthcare and aquaculture. From building AI-bots for
        managing feeding systems in aquaculture to developing models for
        predicting autoclave temperature control and dialysis initiation, I
        thrive on using data-driven approaches to solve complex problems. Driven
        by curiosity and innovation, I continuously seek opportunities to apply
        my technical skills and knowledge to create efficient, impactful
        solutions.
